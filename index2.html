					<h1>The Office(U.S) Quotes</h1>
					<img alt="Office" src="Images/reg_1024.OfficePoster.mh.082412.jpg">
						<p>Dwight K. Schrute: No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the Commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.</p> 
						<p>Dwight K. Schrute: I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro from "Heroes." That's a real hero. Also Bono.</p>
						<p>Dwight K. Schrute: I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for "Grizzly Man" and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured i was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. Cuz that's the thing about bear attacks... they come when you least expect it."</p>
						<p>Dwight K. Schrute: I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once, but by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbour's dog.</p>
						<p>Michael G. Scott: Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.</p>																				
						<p>Michael G. Scott: That's what she said!</p>												
						<p>Michael G. Scott:  Hey! I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid I got no respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, said "I don't respect you." Aaaaaaaah. Thoughtless. You know what don't get no respect? Air plane food. Why don't they just make the plane outta the airline food. My wife don't get no respect, so take her please. If you don't get no respect, you might be a redneck. Respect, is niceee. Boy. What's the deal with grapenuts? No grapes no nuts. I don't get no respect.</p>
						<p>Michael G. Scott: There has been a murder!There has been a murder...in Savannah </p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Question. What kind of bear is best?</p>
	                    <p>Dwight Schrute:	That's a ridiculous question.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	False. Black bear.</p>
						<p>	Dwight Schrute:	That's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought--</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute: Bears do not... What is going on?! What are you doing?!</p>
						<p>Dwight: You know what; imitation is the most sincere form of flattery so I thank you.</p>
						<p> [Jim takes out a bobble head and places it on the desk.]</p>
						<p>Dwight: Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert: Michael!</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute: Oh that's funny. Michael!</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check-in time in now, check-out time is never.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Does my room have cable?</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:No. And the sheets are made of fire.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Can I change rooms?</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:Sorry we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Can I have a late check-out?</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:I'll have to talk to the manager.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	You're not the manager, even in your own fantasy?</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:I'm the owner.. the co-owner. With Satan!</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Okay, just so I understand it. In your wildest fantasy, you are in hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:But I haven't told you my salary yet.</p>
						<p>Jim Halpert:	Go.</p>
						<p>Dwight Schrute:Eighty thousand dollars.</p>
